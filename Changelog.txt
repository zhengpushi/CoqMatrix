2023.01.20
v1.0.0
1. initial version

2023.01.20
v1.0.1
1.remove the dependency for CoqExt library, which is charged by myself.
2.add dependency of coq-mathcomp-algebra, >=8.15.0
	
2023.01.21
v1.0.2
1. fix a bug under OCaml 4.07.1, thus Coq (>= 8.13) could use this library.

2023.02.28
v1.0.3
1. Add a new matrix model naming SF (SafeNatFun), which is a safe version of NF (NatFun).
   Meanwhile, added conversions between SF and DL/DP/DR/NF/SF, see MatrixAll.v
2. Add a unified tactic "lma" (means Linear Matrix Arithmetic) to solve matrix equations
   such as "A == B", and it is available in all models.
   This tactic also worked for vector equations.
3. Add several concrete modules, including MatrixNat, MatrixZ, MatrixQ, MatrixQc, MatrixR,
   VectorNat, VectorZ, VectorQ, VectorQc, VectorR.
   These modules are convenient for final developers.
   The demo usage can be found in each file, such as MatrixR, or can be quickly found in README.md
4. Add usage demo in README.md

2023.05.20
v1.0.4
1. update module SafeNatFun, and additionally, determinant of generic matrix and inversion matrix
   by adjoint matrix.
2. Preliminary calculus theory.
3. Better notation for mnth function, with "m!i!j" instead of "m$i$j".
4. change A0,A1 to Azero,Aone, because A1 is conflict to the name in Reals.
5. Temporarily block the "FinFun" model, because the upgrade of math-comp library to 2.0,
   and this version is unstable now.

2023.06.20
v1.0.5
1. Add SF model to ocaml_test_example.

2023.10.17
(no public version)
1. Add a new model naming SF2 (SafeNatFun2), which is a variant of SF.
   SF: first define matrix, then deriving row vector or column vector
   SF2: first define vector, then deriving matrix. This model has good scalability for higher dimensional vectors.

2024.01.16
(preparing new version)
1. To support Coq 8.18.
